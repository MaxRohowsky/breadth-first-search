## Description

This is a visual implementation of the **Breadth-First Search** algorithm.

You can manually draw walls, and the algorithm will find the path from the start to the end.

## Installation
Requirements: You must have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed and preferably a code editor like [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).

1. Clone the repository 
2. In the terminal, navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned, e.g., `C:\Users\Max\PycharmProjects\breadth-first-search-algorithm`
3. Create a virtual environment, activate it, and install pygame by running the following commands in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv #This creates a virtual environment
    venv\Scripts\activate #This activates the virtual environment
    pip install -r requirements.txt #This installs the required libraries
    ```
4. Run the game by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```bash
    python pathfinding.py
    ```

## Controls
- Left mouse to draw walls
- Right mouse to set target point
- Space to start the algorithm

## Libraries

- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news): Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
